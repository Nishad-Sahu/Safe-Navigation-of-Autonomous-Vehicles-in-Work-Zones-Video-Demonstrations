This repository hosts links to the video demonstrations from our U.S. Department of Transportation (USDoT) Automated Driving Systems (ADS) project on the safe navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in roadway work zones.

The videos shows the CMU AV stack CADRE (Connected and Autonomous Driving Reseach and Engineering) driving autonomously in 20+ work zone scenarios defined by Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PENNDoT) in both simulation and Real-world.
