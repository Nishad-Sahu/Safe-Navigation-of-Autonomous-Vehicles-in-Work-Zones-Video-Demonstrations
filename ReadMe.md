This repository hosts links to the video demonstrations from our U.S. Department of Transportation (USDoT) Automated Driving Systems (ADS) project on the safe navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in roadway work zones.

The videos shows the CMU AV stack CADRE (Connected and Autonomous Driving Reseach and Engineering) driving autonomously in 20+ work zone scenarios defined by Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PENNDoT) in both simulation and real-world.

**_SafeRoute++_** augments _**SafeRoute**_ by converting raw work zone information to semantic level information for better real-time performance. It also adds a decay factor to the work zone infornation and integrates mobile work zone object. 

The following video shows **_SafeRoute++_** converting raw work zone infomation recieved via V2X/cloud into semantic information in CADRE simulation : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ESwaSdSyFCEOVvsOjXX6pMYDJiG0WWTZ/view?usp=sharing
